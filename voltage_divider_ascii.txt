BATTERY VOLTAGE DIVIDER
=======================

Project: nRF_Jammer_v3
Purpose: Measure 3.7V Li-ion battery voltage with ESP32 ADC

               |
              R1
             100kΩ
               |
               |-----> To ESP32 ADC (GPIO 34)
               |
              R2
             100kΩ
               |
               |
              GND

Explanation:
------------
- R1 and R2 form a simple resistor voltage divider.
- With R1 = R2 = 100kΩ, the output voltage at the midpoint (ADC input) is half of the battery voltage.
- For a 3.7V battery, ADC sees ~1.85V max.
- ESP32 ADC max voltage ~3.3V, so this is safe.
- The resistors also limit current draw to <20µA, reducing battery drain.

Calculation:
------------
Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2))
Vout = 3.7V * (100k / (100k + 100k)) = 3.7V * 0.5 ≈ 1.85V

Notes:
------
- Use precise resistors (1% tolerance) for better voltage readings.
- Optional: add a small capacitor (~0.1µF) between ADC input and GND to smooth readings.
- Do NOT connect battery directly to ADC pin — it will damage the ESP32.
- Ensure ESP32 GND is connected to battery GND.

Description:
------------
- R1 and R2 form a voltage divider for battery voltage measurement.
- The ADC input sees half of the battery voltage.
- For a fully charged Li-ion battery (~4.2V), ADC voltage ≈ 2.1V.
- This is within the safe operating range of the ESP32 ADC (max ~3.3V).
- Current draw of the divider is very low (<25µA).

Optional:
---------
- A small capacitor (e.g. 0.1µF) can be added between ADC and GND
  to stabilize readings and reduce noise.


nRF24 MODULE POWER SUPPLY NOTES
-------------------------------

IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MODULES:

- nRF24E01:
  * Can be powered directly from the Li-ion battery (3.0V–4.2V).
  * No external 3.3V regulator is strictly required.
  * Local decoupling capacitors are still REQUIRED.

- nRF24L01:
  * MUST be powered from a stable 3.3V supply.
  * Direct connection to a Li-ion battery WILL DAMAGE the module.
  * A dedicated 3.3V voltage regulator is REQUIRED.


DECOUPLING CAPACITORS (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------
Each nRF24 module should have capacitors placed as close as possible
to its power pins to ensure stable operation.

Recommended values:
- 100nF (0.1µF) ceramic capacitor
- 4.7µF – 10µF electrolytic or ceramic capacitor

                       GND

(Optionally add 4.7µF–10µF in parallel)


NOTES
-----
- All grounds (battery, ESP32, nRF modules) MUST be connected together.
- Place capacitors as close as possible to the nRF24 power pins.
- Poor decoupling may cause unstable RF behavior or module resets.
- Never connect nRF24L01 directly to battery voltage.
